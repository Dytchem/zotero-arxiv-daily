All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- `executor.min_score` config: drop papers below a relevance threshold (0-10) before sending, `null` keeps all. Reduces noise from barely-related candidates.
- Cross-source dedupe: the same preprint posted to both arXiv and bioRxiv/medRxiv is now matched by normalized title and sent only once.
- Email rendering upgrade: paper titles link to the abstract page, source badge (arXiv/bioRxiv/medRxiv) per card, and a header summary ("N papers recommended for you").
- `email.receivers`: extra recipients in addition to `receiver` (Cc), as a YAML list or comma-separated string.
- Top-level exception handling in `main.py`: fatal errors are logged with a full traceback and a non-zero exit code (so the workflow failure notification fires reliably).

### Changed
- No-email decision now also triggers when every candidate was filtered out by `min_score` (previously only when zero papers were retrieved).

### Fixed
- HTML email renders gracefully when a paper has no PDF URL (button omitted instead of a broken `None` link).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07
